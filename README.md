# Rusty V8 Derive Macros

Derive macros for the [Rusty V8](https://github.com/denoland/rusty_v8) Bindings.

These annotations make it easier to convert JavaScript Values to Rust structs and vice versa.

## Usage

See the [v8_derive_example](https://github.com/mibes404/v8_derive/tree/main/v8_derive_sample) for a complete example.

```rust
use v8::{ContextOptions, CreateParams};
use v8_derive::{IntoValue, TryFromValue};
use v8_derive_macros::{FromValue, IntoValue};

#[derive(FromValue, IntoValue)]
struct SimpleObject {
    yes_no: bool,
    name: String,
    age: i32,
    opt: Option<i32>,
}

fn main() {
    // Set the v8 Javascript Value from a Rust struct
    let js_obj = rust_obj.into_value(scope);

    // Get the V8 Javascript Value as a Rust struct
    let rust_obj = SimpleObject::try_from_value(&js_obj, scope).unwrap();
}
```

## Supported Types

- `bool`
- `String`
- `i8`
- `i32`
- `i64`
- `f64`
- `u32`
- `f32`
- `Option<T>` where `T` is one of the above types
- `struct` where all fields are one of the above types
- `Vec<T>` where `T` is one of the above types
